<sup>1</sup> There's a step in the "Refreshing an Access Token" video that's accidentally omitted. To use the accessTokenCache constant, you must require the Node library Node-Cache. Then, underneath the `const refreshTokenStore = {};`, you must add in `const accessTokenCache = new NodeCache({ deleteOnExpire: true});`. This is reflected in the finished index.js file.
